    <h2>I am an awesome h2</h2>

    <p>A memoir is best described as a collection of memories that an individual writes about.
       These could be about moments or events both public or private, that took place in the subject’s life.
       I think “The Glass Castle” by Jeanette Walls is a good example of a memoir.
       The writer goes ahead to talk about her experiences from going through a tough childhood growing up in a dysfunctional family. Walls grew up with 3 siblings, an alcoholic Dad (Rex Walls) and a mother who often neglected her children because she thought the fact of bearing children was burden to her. She would rather spend her time sketching or painting than worrying about what her children would have for dinner. “Despite all the hardships, and a tough childhood, Jeannette Walls was able to overcome her challenges and succeed in life.”

        <p>I believe Jeanette Walls went through a rough childhood basing on the way she narrated her experiences and events with her family. She was a victim of neglect from her parents at a very tender age of three. For example, one the earliest events in the book was when she was on fire.
        “I felt a blaze of heat on my right side. I turned to see where it was coming from and I realized I was on fire.” (Walls 9).
         This clearly shows an <em>example of neglect</em> from her mother who was at home with her when this event happened. She let her little girl(Jeanette) near a stove to cook hot dogs and eventually got burnt. This is one way Jeanette Walls narrated to us a very significant event or highlight in her childhood and it fits perfectly in her autobiographical account/memoir.
    The Glass Castle story goes on to reveal more significant events in Jeanette Walls life and how she learnt to take on challenges and become a stronger person. For example, how she learnt to swim the hard way. “He put an arm around me, and we started across the water. Dad was dragging me. I felt terrified and I clutched his neck so tightly that his skin turned white…We
